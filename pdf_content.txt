Synopsis
 
 

--- Page 3 ---
Students
 
have
 
to
 
develop
 
on
 
real
 
life
 
oriented
 
projects
 
that
 
means
 
solve
 
a
  
complex
 
engineering
 
problem
 
in
 
this
 
course.
 
For
 
development
 
purposes,
  

--- Page 4 ---
modern
 
technologies
 
are
 
preferred,
 
including
 
frontend
 
frameworks
 
(React.js,
  
Angular,
 
Vue.js,
 
etc.),
 
backend
 
platforms
 
(Node.js,
 
ASP.NET
 
Core,
 
Django,
  
 
etc.),
 
full-stack
 
solutions
 
(Next.js,
 
Laravel,
 
Ruby
 
on
 
Rails,
 
etc.),
 
and
 
a
 
variety
 
of
  
database
 
systems
 
(MySQL,
 
PostgreSQL,
 
MongoDB,
 
Oracle,
 
etc.).
 
Open
 
Source
  
projects
 
are
 
also
 
preferred
 
as
 
Open
 
source
 
code
 
is
 
typically
 
created
 
through
 
a
  
collaborative
 
effort
 
in
 
which
 
programmers
 
improve
 
upon
 
the
 
code
 
and
 
share
 
the
  
changes
 
within
 
the
 
community.
 
Moreover,
 
documentation
 
is
 
a
 
major
 
concern
 
for
  
the
 
project
 
to
 
ensure
 
the
 
Software
 
Quality
 
Assurance
 
(SQA
).
 
Hence
 
at
 
the
 
end
 
of
  
semester
 
students
 
submit
 
their
 
projects
 
including
 
the
 
documentation
.

Comple x Engineering Problem  
--- Page 40 ---
Design a simple Bangla Speech Recognition system.  
Such a system can be incorpor ated with a wheelchair to mak e it voice controlled and  
--- Page 41 ---
thus enables a physically handic apped person to move freely without the help of a  
constant
 
care-
 
giver.
 
Mor eover,
 
the
 
ability
 
to
 
give
 
commands
 
in
 
Bangla
 
will
 
mak e
 
the
  
system
 
more
 
user -
 
friendly
 
in
 
the
 
context
 
of
 
Bangladesh.
 
 
The system should be speak er-independen t, i.e. it is requir ed that the Bangla speech  
recognition
 
system
 
should
 
work
 
satisfactorily
 
irrespectiv e
 
of
 
sex,
 
age-group,
 
or
 
dialect
 
of
  
the
 
speak er.
 
 
Studen ts are requir ed to explor e different methodologies to investigate the problem  
through
 
design
 
of
 
experimen t
 
and
 
data
 
analy sis
 
and
 
select
 
or
 
develop
 
an
 
optimal
  
methodology
 
for
 
design
 
of
 
the
 
system.
