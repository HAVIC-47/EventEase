# üè¢ Confirmed Venue Bookings Review System - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ **Feature Implementation Complete**

### **User Request:**
- Users can post/update reviews from the **confirmed venue bookings section** in the dashboard
- Users can only review **after their booking date has passed**
- If clicked before completion, show **"Please wait for the event to end"**

### **Implementation Details:**

#### 1. **Backend Logic (users/views.py)**
```python
# Add review context for confirmed venues
for booking in confirmed_venues:
    # Check if booking is completed (end date has passed)
    booking_completed = booking.end_date < now
    
    # Check if user has already reviewed this venue
    booking.user_review = VenueReview.objects.filter(venue=booking.venue, user=user).first()
    
    # User can review if booking is completed and no existing review
    booking.can_review = booking_completed and not booking.user_review
    
    # Set review status message
    if not booking_completed:
        booking.review_status = "Please wait for the event to end"
    elif booking.user_review:
        booking.review_status = "You have reviewed this venue"
    else:
        booking.review_status = "You can review this venue"
```

#### 2. **Frontend Template (dashboard.html)**
- **Review Status Indicator**: Shows colored status message
- **Smart Button Logic**:
  - ‚úÖ **"View Your Review"** + **"Update Review"** ‚Üí When user has reviewed
  - ‚≠ê **"Leave Review"** ‚Üí When booking completed, no review yet
  - üö´ **"Review" (disabled)** ‚Üí When booking not yet completed

#### 3. **CSS Styling**
```css
.review-available { color: #28a745; background-color: #d4edda; }  /* Green */
.review-completed { color: #40B5AD; background-color: #d1ecf1; }  /* Teal */
.review-waiting { color: #856404; background-color: #fff3cd; }    /* Yellow */
```
