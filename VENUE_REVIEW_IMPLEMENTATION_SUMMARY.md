## 📊 Technical Implementation Details

### **Database Models**
```python
# VenueReview validation logic
def clean(self):
    if not VenueBooking.objects.filter(
        user=self.user,
        venue=self.venue,
        status__in=['confirmed', 'completed'],
        end_date__lt=timezone.now()
    ).exists():
        raise ValidationError('You can only review venues that you have booked and where your booking has been completed.')
```

### **Dashboard View Logic**
```python
# Past venues with review context
past_venues = venue_bookings.filter(end_date__lt=now)
for booking in past_venues:
    booking.can_review = (
        booking.status in ['confirmed', 'completed'] and
        booking.end_date < now and
        not VenueReview.objects.filter(venue=booking.venue, user=user).exists()
    )
    booking.user_review = VenueReview.objects.filter(venue=booking.venue, user=user).first()
```

### **Template Logic**
```html
<!-- Dashboard venue review buttons -->
{% if booking.user_review %}
    <a href="{% url 'reviews:venue_reviews' booking.venue.id %}" class="btn btn-success">✅ View Your Review</a>
{% elif booking.can_review %}
    <a href="{% url 'reviews:submit_venue_review' booking.venue.id %}" class="btn btn-secondary">⭐ Leave Review</a>
{% else %}
    <span class="btn btn-secondary disabled">⭐ Review</span>
{% endif %}
```

## 🚀 User Experience Flow

1. **User books a venue** → VenueBooking created
2. **Venue booking is confirmed** → Status becomes 'confirmed' or 'completed'  
3. **Booking period ends** → `end_date < now()`
4. **Dashboard shows review option** → "⭐ Leave Review" button appears
5. **User clicks review button** → Redirected to review submission form
6. **User submits review** → VenueReview created with validation
7. **Dashboard updates** → Shows "✅ View Your Review" button
8. **Venue detail page** → Shows user's review and rating
