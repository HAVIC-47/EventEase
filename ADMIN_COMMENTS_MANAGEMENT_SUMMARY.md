I have successfully implemented a comprehensive Comments Management system for the admin dashboard, allowing administrators to view and manage all comments from events and venues in one centralized location.

  - Real-time counts with breakdown by type
  - Most active commenters identification

### 2. **🔍 Advanced Search and Filtering**
- **Real-time Search**: Search across comments, event/venue names, and user details
- **Type Filtering**: Filter by "All Comments", "Event Comments Only", or "Venue Comments Only"
- **Combined Search**: Search functionality works across both event and venue comments
- **User Search**: Find comments by username, first name, last name, or email

### 3. **📋 Comprehensive Comments Display**
Each comment shows complete details:

```

### **URL Routing (users/urls.py)**

```

```

### **Database Optimization**
